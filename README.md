# The-Texas-Department-of-Insurance-TDI
In this project, I build an ETL Pipeline for TDI [Insurance Complaints Data](https://data.texas.gov/dataset/Insurance-complaints-All-data/ubdr-4uff/about_data) using Python, Snowflake.

I start with extracting the data from Texas Open Data API, then perform some transformations, data validation, and then, finally load it into Snowflake.

In Snowflake, I perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer some questions.

**About the data**

There are about 246,315 rows present for the insurance complaints data updated on February 29, 2024. This dataset includes a row for each person and organization named in a complaint. This means some complaint numbers are listed multiple times.

**Skills demonstrated**

1.Understanding dataset and reading supporting documentation.

2.Writing code in Python to extract data from Texas Open Data API.

3.Checking for data quality and transformations.

4.Creating a data warehouse in Snowflake so that it's easier for the downstream users to perform data analysis.

5.Data analysis - answering stakeholderâ€™s questions.
